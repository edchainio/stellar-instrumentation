# Stellar Instrumentation

This repository was forked from, and originally named, [StellarTerm client](https://github.com/stellarterm/stellarterm-desktop-client).

**Its sole purpose is to serve as a learning tool for edChain developers and should not be deployed into a production environment as its runtime environment has been repurposed explicity for testing.**
